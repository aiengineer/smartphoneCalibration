    A simplified form of observer for estimation, data smoothing and control applications.
    Algorithm summary:
    Initialize:
    Set the initial values of state estimates x and v, using prior information or additional measurements;
     otherwise, set the initial state values to zero.
    Select values of the alpha and beta correction gains.
    Update: Repeat for each time step Î”T.
